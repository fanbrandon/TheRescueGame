# TheRescueGame

Developed an interactive, object-oriented video game where players control a spaceship
to rescue astronauts and avoid aliens. Built the game in multiple stages:

Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including spaceship movement and astronaut
rescue, controlled through a user interface.

Enhanced gameplay with a GUI, integrating the Model-View-Controller pattern,
commands for all actions, and visual score/map views.

Finalized the game with timer-driven animation, automatic collision detection, sound
effects, and interactive graphics. Incorporated object selection and a pause/play mode for
a dynamic user experience.
